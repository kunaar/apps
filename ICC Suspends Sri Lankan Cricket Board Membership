ICC Suspends Sri Lankan Cricket Board Membership

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to suspend the membership of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board, citing political interference as the primary reason.

According to ICC sources, the recognition of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board has been put on hold due to alleged political meddling. Following a shameful defeat against India, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Sports had dismissed the officials of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board.

Until the suspension is lifted, Sri Lanka’s team will not be able to participate in any ICC events. The fate of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board will be further discussed and decided upon in the Executive Board meeting scheduled for November 21.

This move has raised eyebrows within the cricketing community, as political interference in sports is typically frowned upon. Critics argue that such actions can have long-lasting consequences on the country’s cricketing future, affecting players and fans alike. The international cricket fraternity is now keenly awaiting the outcome of the upcoming ICC meeting to understand the implications and potential resolutions regarding this matter.
